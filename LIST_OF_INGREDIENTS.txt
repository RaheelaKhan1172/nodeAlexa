Due to the high alcohol content and oils, absinthe drinkers usually add 3-5 parts ice water to one part absinthe.  Absinthe is slightly bitter. It originated in Switzerland as an elixir in the early 19th century.  Currently the USA has a ban on absinthe being imported. In other countries like Switzerland it can be purchased.  \r\n\r\nAbsinthe was banned in most countries for the last 100 or so years. However, this was declared legal in 2006. It can be found in spirit stores such as under names like Absent, Lucid, and Absinth.\r\nAbsinthe is traditionally prepared with water and sugar, with a spirit/water ratio of 1:3 to 1:5. The alcohol is poured into a glass and a slotted spoon is placed in the rim with a sugar cube on top of the spoon. Ice water is slowly poured onto the cube, and the sugar water mixes with the absinthe to create a milky green mixture called a louche (pronounced loosh in French)\r\n","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Cocktails","all_category_list":"Cocktails","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/absinthe-896","ingred_id":"896","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-356","score":"1.0007906","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Achar","description":"An east Indian word referring to pickled and salted relishes which can be made sweet or hot.

It is an important crop for direct human consumption and for animal feed. It is unique as a source of malt for beer and other products.  Barley was one of the first domesticated cereals, most likely originating in the Fertile Crescent area of the Near East. Many references to barley and beer are found in early Egyptian writings that are more than 5000 years old. All barley varieties are covered with a tough inedible hull. This hull must be removed in order for the kernel inside to be used for human food. The outer hull is removed by a mechanical sanding process that is called “pearling”.  Pearled barley is the most readily available product and may be found in most supermarkets next to dry beans, rice and lentils. Barley may be pearled to varying degrees. The more the barley is pearled, the lighter in color the end product appears. Most of the barley sold in supermarkets as “pearled barley” has been only lightly pearled. This means that the tough inedible outer hull has been sanded off as well as some, but not all, of the bran layer. Lightly pearled barley appears light brown in color, similar to the color of brown rice. The light brown color indicates the presence of bran (outer layer of the kernel).  Lightly pearled barley may be considered whole grain because the kernel retains some bran\r\nas well as the germ and endosperm. More heavily pearled barley appears white in color (similar to white rice).  \r\nBarley flour, flakes, and grits may be found in health food and specialty stores. Barley is also used as a commercial ingredient in prepared foods such as breakfast cereals, soups, pilaf mixes, breads, cookies, crackers and snack bars. \r\n<br>Barley was one of the most used grains of the Scots.

The raw material for gelatin is the naturally occuring protein, collagen, which is commercially obtained from the meat industry (pure protein derived from beef and veal bones, cartilage, tendons, skin and connective tissue).  Most commercial gelatin is produced from pig skin.  The cleaning and processing of collagen results in a pale yellow dry powder -- an odorless, tasteless thickening agent.  When dissolved in hot water then cooled, it forms a jelly.  Granulated gelatin is the most common form of unsweetened gelatin.  Unsweetened gelatin is typically soaked in a cold liquid for 3-5 minutes before dissolving it.  This softens and swells the granules so they will dissolve smoothly when heated.  Leaf or sheet gelatin is also available, although not as common as the granulated form.  Leaf gelatin requires a longer soaking time than granulated gelatin.  Sweetened gelatin dessert mixes, such as the popular Jell-O brand, are available in many artificial fruit flavors.  <br>\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessional cooks often use leaf gelatin because it makes a clearer gelatin with purer flavor. Many European recipes call for leaf gelatin. \r\n\r\nYou can successfully substitute powdered gelatin for leaf gelatin in any recipe. One package (1 tablespoon) of powdered gelatin equals 4 sheets. One package of gelatin is enough to jell 2 cups of liquid.\r\n\r\n<b>Vegan/Vegetarian:</b>  Alternative choices include Agar-Agar, which is derived from seaweed.

Though crisp, succulent and wilt-resistant, all crispheads have a rather neutral flavor.  Romaine lettuce grows in a long head of sturdy leaves which have a firm rib down their centers.  Varieties include green, red and baby romaine. Romaine is the classic lettuce of choice for Caesar salads.  Because it's said to have originated on the Aegean island of Cos, romaine is also called Cos lettuce.  The term head lettuce describes those varieties on which the leaves grow in a dense rosette.

Today cow's milk is one of the most popular animal milks consumed by humans.  Around the world, people drink the milk of many other animals including camels, goats, llamas, reindeer, sheep and water buffalo.  Milk is available in many varieties.  Raw milk has not been pastuerized, and is usually available in natural food stores.  Whole milk is the milk as it came from the cow and contains about 3.5% milk fat.  Low-fat milk is available in two types, 2% and 1%.  The 1% and 2% designations refer to the percent of fat by weight that the milk contains..  Nonfat or skim milk must by law contain less than .5% milk fat.  Buttermilk was once the liquid left after butter was churned.  Today, <a href=\"/library/getentry.zsp?id=143\">buttermilk</a> is made commercially by adding special bacteria to nonfat or low-fat milk, giving it a slightly thickened texture and tangy flavor.  Low-sodium milk has 90% of the sodium replaced by potassium.  Lactose-reduced low-fat milk is a special milk with less than 30% lactose content.  Ultrapasteurized milk has been heated to approximately 300F then vacuum-packed.  This milk may be stored without refrigeration up to 6 months unopened.    Most milk sold in the United States is pasteurized, which means the micro-organisms that cause disease (such as salmonella and hepatitis) and spoilage have been destroyed by heating, then quick-cooling the milk.  Pasteurization also gives milk a longer shelf life.  Most commercial milk products have also been homogenized, meaning the milk fat globules have been broken down until they are evenly and imperceptibly distributed thoughout the milk and the liquid is uniformly smooth.  In Canada, whole milk means milk that has not been homogenized. There are a variety of dry and canned milk products on the market including dry milk, <a href=\"/library/getentry.zsp?id=500\">evaporated milk</a>, and <a href=\"/library/getentry.zsp?id=146\">sweetened condensed milk</a>.

To maintain the stronger taste that consumers expect, some spice companies add cayenne to heat up Hungarian paprika.  Commercial food manufacturers use paprika to add color. If a food item is colored red, orange or reddish brown and the label lists \"Natural Color,\" it is likely paprika.  Paprika releases its color and flavor when heated.

The term \"pasta filata\" translates to \"spun paste\". Though these cheeses have curds with a common structure, they vary widely. Pasts filata cheeses may be fresh and unripened, soft to firm, ripened and firm to hard, smoked or not, mild or piquant, to many shapes and sizes. Here are a few to check out. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Caciocavallo~</b> translates to \"horse\" in Italian. Caciocavallo comes from Campania in southern Italy. Today, cow's milk gives this cheese its straightforward, full and mellow flavor. This cheese is a style of Provolone, with a golden yellow interior, firm texture, and intense and lingering aroma. At three months of age, Caciocavallo is sweet and supple, enjoyed as a table cheese. As it hardens with age, it becomes a grating cheese. As a table cheese, Caciocavallo is great with fruit (figs, dates and melon), ham, mushrooms, olives, roasted peppers, and crusty Italian bread. It can be used in place of Provolone and Mozzarella. A mature Caciocavallo is excellent grated over pasta and potato dishes. Chianti Classico, Zinfandel or Cabernet complement Caciocavallo well. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Kasseri~</b> Kasseri is a stretched curd cheese with a combination of sheep's milk and goat's milk, or cow's milk. Domestic Kasseri is 80 percent to 100 percent cow's milk. \r\nKasseri is salty and full-flavored. The texture is rubbery, resembling Provolone. Kasseri is used in Greece in place of Mozzarella. Other Greek cheeses in the Kasseri family include Kefalotyri and Keflograviera. Kasseri is a great cheese to saute, grill or serve with raw vegetables. Try with dried fruits, figs and dates. Olive bread is a good choice, as well as almonds, Serrano ham and olives. Red Wine Recommendations are Claret, Cabernet or Pinot Noir. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Scamorza~</b> Although similar to Mozzarella and Provolone, Scamorza is drier and chewier. Scamorza matures within a few days and has a mild flavor. Scamorza Affumicate is a popular smoked version. Scamorza Affumicate produced in the United States is smoked over burning pecan shells. Use Scamorza Affumicate in pasta dishes. It is wonderful with ham, mushrooms or grilled veggies. Plain Scamorza can be used in place of Mozzarella or Provolone. Fruit choices are figs, dates and melon. Crusty Italian and foccacia are good bread choices. Choose Italian Reds such as Chianti, Sangiovese or Cabernet Sauvignon. <p>\r\n\r\n<b><a href=\"/library/getentry.zsp?id=663\">Asadero</a></b> ~ Often referred to as Mexican Mozzarella, Asadero was created in Oaxaca. It is a cow's milk cheese sometimes called Queso Oazaca, and is similar to Provolone. It is an excellent cooking cheese. It's flavor ranges from quite bland to buttery and sweet. Great for chili con queso, fondue, quesadillas to cubed in tortilla soup. Asadero complements peaches, apples and pears. Flour tortillas, jalapenos, beans, chilies, roasted peppers and salsa are great accompaniments to Asadero. Wine choices are Chardonnay, Sangria, or even sparkling wines and Champagne. <p>\r\n\r\nRipened Mozzarella and Provolone are in the Pasta Filata Family. <p>\r\n\r\nContributed by DiB's","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Cheese","all_category_list":"Cheese","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/pasta-filata-cheese-914","ingred_id":"914","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-121","score":"1.0081819","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Anchovy paste","description":"A mix of ground anchovies, vinegar, spices and water, with a salty pungent flavor that goes a long way.","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Fish","all_category_list":"Fish","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/anchovy-paste-121","ingred_id":"121","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-547","score":"1.0070341","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:05 UTC 2016","title":"Almond paste","description":"A mixture of blanched ground almonds, sugar, and glycerin or other liquid.

Any food can be pickled (verb), but a \"pickle\" (noun) refers to a pickled cucumber.  Pickles can be sour, sweet, hot or flavored.  There are pickled vegetables (cucumbers, pearl onions, cauliflower, baby corn, watermelon rind) as well as various pickled fish, herring, pig's feet, etc.  Pickling is one of the oldest methods of preserving foods. Pickling is the preserving of food in an acid (usually vinegar), and it is this acid environment that prevents undesirable bacteria growth.  However, how and what kind of acid gets into the liquid is what can cause some confusion about the use of salt.  Most pickled foods are salted or soaked in brine first to draw out moisture that would dilute the acid that is added to 'pickle' the food.  (1) Vinegar can be added directly to the liquid that the food is placed in.  (2) The food can be place in brine (salt and water).  Even though it may seem that pickling can be done with either an acid (vinegar, etc.) or salt, that is not strictly true because the amount of salt in the solution is carefully measured to allow natural fermentation which produces lactic acid. So pickled foods that are made with brine (salt and water) are really made with an acid- - but instead of directly adding acid, conditions are created so that the fermentation creates its own acid.  This is a tricky process because just enough salt needs to be added to prevent the growth of undesirable bacteria, and the correct temperature maintained, to still allow the growth of several specific bacteria that produce lactic acid.  (3) Some cucumber pickles are made with a combination of both methods. They are soaked in a strong brine with vinegar added in specific proportions so that they still ferment and produce additional acid (lactic acid).","main_submit_date":"1429191280","primary_category_name":"Canning","all_category_list":"Canning","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/pickle-607","ingred_id":"607","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:40.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-730","score":"1.0023627","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:05 UTC 2016","title":"Pickling lime","description":"For use in pickling recipes.

Be sure to use pickling lime as a soak solution only and to rinse product in several changes of water before proceeding with the recipe.

Pickling lime is found in most grocery stores with the pickling supplies.  \r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the Lime is alkaline, you have to get rid of it all, or it would neutralize the acidity that you are going to use to preserve the pickles with. People haven't always rinsed it thoroughly, though, leaving some alkalinity and raising the pH of the pickling batch by neutralizing the acidity.

Plantains are more starchy than sweet and must be cooked before being eaten. They are a staple crop in much of Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, and Asia and are served boiled, steamed, baked, or fried.  In these countries plantains are consumed as a vegetable.  Plantains resemble bananas but are longer, thicker and starchier in flavor. They can be prepared in all stages of ripeness, with nearly no waste and have excellent taste.  As a plantain ripens, its high starch content changes to sugar.  Plantains also\r\nkeep their shape when cooked, unlike bananas, which get mushy.  They can be used in soups, stews, boiled and mashed. Most Puerto Rican recipes that use plantains call for green plantains.  Plátanos verdes need to be VERY green without a hint of yellow.  The next stage of ripeness is when the skin is mostly yellow with a few black speckles.  In this stage of ripeness, the plantain has lost some of its starch and is slightly sweet.  Plantains at this stage can be thinly sliced and fried, mashed or they can be baked until\r\ntender and served with roasted meats.  When a plantain is totally ripe, the peel is almost completely black. Although these plantains might look past their prime, this is when their sugar content is the highest but the flesh is still nice and firm. It is at this stage that the plantain most resembles a banana.  A ripe plantain can be used in savory or sweet dishes. You pan-fry them with some butter, rum, and brown sugar and serve over ice cream.","main_submit_date":"1429191280","primary_category_name":"Bananas","all_category_list":"Bananas","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/plantain-279","ingred_id":"279","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:40.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-66","score":"1.0071299","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Plum","description":"Plums grow in clusters and have a smooth, deeply colored skin and a center pit.

Its flavor is delicate, almost bland, and has been compared to couscous or rice.  Quinoa is lighter, but can be used in any way suitable for rice.  Quinoa contains more protein than any other grain, and is higher in unsaturated fats and lower in carbohydrates than most grains and is a very good source of calcium, iron, phosphorous, B vitamins,and vitamin E.  Quinoa's slow-releasing carbohydrates help to maintain blood sugar levels.\r\n\r\n<br>We usually think of quinoa as a grain, but it is actually the seed of a plant that, as its scientific name Chenopodium quinoa reflects, is related to beets, chard and spinach. These amino acid-rich seeds are not only very nutritious, but also very delicious. Cooked quinoa seeds are fluffy and creamy, yet slightly crunchy. They have a delicate, somewhat nutty flavor. While the most popular type of quinoa is a transparent yellow color, other varieties feature colors such as orange, pink, red, purple or black. Although often difficult to find in the marketplace, the leaves of the quinoa plant are edible, with a taste similar to its green-leafed relatives, spinach, chard and beets.\r\n\r\nNot only is quinoa high in protein, but the protein it supplies is complete protein, meaning that it includes all nine essential amino acids. Not only is quinoa's amino acid profile well balanced, making it a good choice for vegans concerned about adequate protein intake, but quinoa is especially well-endowed with the amino acid lysine, which is essential for tissue growth and repair. In addition to protein, quinoa features a host of other health-building nutrients.

There are two major types of mustard seed:  white (or yellow) and brown (Asian),  A third species, the black mustard seed, has been replaced for most purposes by the brown species because the latter can be grown and harvested more economically.  Black mustard is a round hard seed, varying in color from dark brown to black, smaller and much more pungent than the white.  White mustard seeds (round hard beige or straw colored seeds) are much larger than the brown variety, but a lot less pungent.  Its light outer skin is removed before sale. With its milder flavour and good preservative qualities, it is most commonly used in ballpark mustard and in pickling.  White and brown seeds are blended to make English mustard.  Brown mustard seeds are similar in size to the black variety and vary in color\r\nfrom light to dark brown and are more pungent than the white, less than the black. Brown mustard seeds are used for pickling and as a seasoning and are the main ingredient in European and Chinese mustards.  Powdered mustard is simply finely ground mustard seed. Originally mustard was called Sinapis. Some claim that during Roman times the word Sinapis started to be replaced by words such as Mustum, Mustarum, and Mustardum as new wine, or \"Must\" was mixed with mustard seeds to make a paste.  More recent theories come from France. In one, the Duke of Burgundy gave the town of Dijon a coat of arms in 1382 with the motto MOULT ME TARDE.  As the story goes, the motto was adopted by the town’s mustard-makers, who eventually shortened it into Moul-tarde (to burn much).  Another story has it that the motto was given the citizens of Dijon by King Charles VI. In this version, the motto \"MOULT ME TARDE\" meant \"Off to Battle.\" ","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Herb and Spice Mixes","all_category_list":"Herb and Spice Mixes","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/mustard-seed-and-powder-93","ingred_id":"93","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-318","score":"1.0061077","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Caraway seed","description":"A seed with a nutty, anise flavor from the parsley family.","main_submit_date":"1429191280","primary_category_name":"Herb and Spice Mixes","all_category_list":"Herb and Spice Mixes","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/caraway-seed-318","ingred_id":"318","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:40.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-321","score":"1.0048221","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Celery seed","description":"The seed of the celery has a strong flavor.","main_submit_date":"1429191280","primary_category_name":"Herb and Spice Mixes","all_category_list":"Herb and Spice Mixes","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/celery-seed-321","ingred_id":"321","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:40.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-339","score":"1.0004185","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Poppy seed","main_submit_date":"1429191280","primary_category_name":"Nuts","all_category_list":"Nuts","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/poppy-seed-339","primary_photo_url":"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/library/339.jpg","ingred_id":"339","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:40.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-391","score":"1.007034","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Seed","description":"To remove the seed from","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Vegetable","all_category_list":"Vegetable","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/seed-391","ingred_id":"391","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"}]},"comscore":"pageview_candidate"}{"response":{"parameters":{"numRecords":"10","offset":"720","recordType":"Ingredient","id":"0"},"totalResultsCount":"982","results":[{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-397","score":"1.0010997","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Annatto seed","description":"Annatto or achiote seed is brick-red with a slightly bitter, earthy flavor and imparts a rich yellowish-orange color in Caribbean, Latin American and Filipino cuisines.

It is excellent to accompany foie-gras and fresh fruit salad. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCream sherries are generally sweetened Amontillado or Oloroso and combine a deep mahogany-color with an intense aroma. Sweet and velvety, with full body. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmontillado is amber in color, naturally dry but with a deep fresh nutty aroma. Smooth and full bodied.

True yams are not widely marketed and are seldom grown in the US; and to add to the confusion, canned sweet potatoes are frequently labeled as yams.

The darker variety has a thicker, dark orange skin and a vivid orange, sweet flesh that is much moister when cooked.  <p>\r\nSweet potatoes are also known as kumara (or kumera) in New Zealand, batatas or boniatos in South America, umala by Samoans, and 'uala by Native Hawaiians.

In the United States \"swiss cheese\" is an imitation of the Swiss Emmental or Emmentaler.  Swiss cheese is a mild cheese made from cow's milk and has a firmer texture than baby Swiss. The flavor is mild, sweet and nut-like.  Swiss cheese is known for being shiny, pale yellow, and having large holes (called eyes) resulting from carbon dioxide released during the maturation process. Cheesemakers can control the size of the holes by changing the acidity, temperature, and curing time. <p>\r\n\r\nCommonly known as \"Swiss\" cheese, Emmental originally came from the Emme River Valley near Bern. Emmental is one of the largest cheeses in the world, requiring 262 gallons of cow's milk for one 200-pound wheel of cheese. It is deep yellow in color and has holes the size of cherries, sometimes up to golf ball size. The scent of Emmental suggests meadows, raisins and wood fires. The flavor is strong and fruity with a mature woody finish. French Emmental has a slightly stronger taste that the Swiss variety. Emmental stands well on its own as a snacking cheese. It is fantastic in salads with mushrooms, cornichons, bell peppers and shallots. A Reuben would not be a Reuben without a slice of melting Emmental. Try a slice with apples or pears, rye, pumpernickel or sourdough breads, coarse mustard's, corned beef and sauerkraut. Fruity red wines such as Beaujolais, Merlot, Syrah or Shiraz are all good choices. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Baby Swiss~</b> pale yellow in color, it has a soft, silky texture with small holes, or eyes and is made from whole cow's milk. The flavor is mild, buttery, creamy and slightly sweet. It makes an excellent melting cheese for egg dishes such as omelets, frittatas and quiches. It complements ham, rye and mustard, as well as apples, pears, grapes cashews and corned beef. White wines such as Chardonnay or Viognier, or a red such as Pinot Noir are good choices. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Swiss-Type Cheeses~</b><p>\r\n\r\n<b>Blarney~</b> Blarney Irish Castle Cheese is a natural, semi-soft part-skim cheese rather like a young Gouda. Available in red wax, it is aged for a minimum of 90 days. Smoked Blarney Irish Castle Cheese is a non-waxed variation naturally smoked over oak fires. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Comte~</b> Actually a member of the Gruyere family, the actual name is Gruyere de Comte. A round cheese with round marble sized holes, it has a tough and darkly colored rind enclosing a yellowish interior. Aged longer than Swiss Gruyere, Comte is a creamy, piquant cheese with a sweet, fruity flavor. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Jarlsberg~</b> is a cheese from Norway that is often subsituted for Emmental. It is made from full-cream cow's milk and is buttery rich, milk and slightly sweet.<p> \r\n\r\n<b>Raclette~</b> a cow's milk cheese that is fantastic heated under a hot grill. The heat intensifies the full, nutty and slightly fruity aroma of Raclette. When grilled, the rind becomes crunchy and has a wonderfully savory flavor. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Tete de Moine~</b> Made from rich summer milk, the interior is firm and creamy to straw yellow, darkening as it ages. The flavor is sweet and tangy with hints of musty wood and nuts. It is the strongest of the Swiss Cheeses. A French counterpart is Girollin. <p>\r\n\r\nContributed by DiB's","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Cheese","all_category_list":"Cheese","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/swiss-cheese-612","primary_photo_url":"http://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/v1/img/library/612.jpg","ingred_id":"612","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-82","score":"1.0049407","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Swordfish","main_submit_date":"1429191275","primary_category_name":"Fish","all_category_list":"Fish","record_url":"http://www.food.com/about/swordfish-82","ingred_id":"82","modtime":"2015-04-16 13:34:35.0"},{"record_type":"Ingredient","record_spec":"Ingredient-138","score":"1.0006641","solr_last_update":"Tue Jun 07 00:19:04 UTC 2016","title":"Corn syrup","description":"A thick sweet syrup which comes in both light and dark varieties, made from processed cornstarch.

As they age, their taste becomes stronger and their texture coarser.  Before potatoes were abundant beyond South America, turnips were everyday staples, particularly in Europe during the Middle Ages. Thriving in a cold, damp climate, turnips were the food of Europe’s poor. At some point in history, the less nutritious turnip gave up its role as an everyday vegetable to the more nutritious potato. In 1730 Charles \"Turnip\" Townshend, a British politician, imported Dutch-grown turnips. He wanted to see if livestock could survive in good health throughout the winter on a diet of turnips. In those days it was expensive to grow and store hay all winter so most people killed their livestock in the fall. This practice left people with too much meat, all at one time. Townshend proved that with turnips, easy to grow and store, farmers could fatten cattle through the winter and slaughter only as needed.

Tortoises live on land and are considered less desirable than terrapin or sea turtles. Regardless of the species, the meat of the female is much more tender than that of the male.

Mexican, Tahitian, Indonesian and Bourbon vanilla are the main varieties. Bourbon vanilla does not contain bourbon -- it is named for the period when the island of Reunion was ruled by the Bourbon kings of France.   Vanilla extract is made by macerating/percolating chopped <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/library/getentry.zsp?id=175\">vanilla beans</a> in ethyl alcohol and water for approximately 48 hours.  The mixture is then aged for several months then filtered.  The FDA specifies that pure vanilla extract contain 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans per gallon during extraction and a 35% alcohol/65% water mixture.  The resulting amber liquid is clear and richly fragrant.  There are double and triple strength vanilla extracts, as well as a vanilla essence -- so strong that only a drop or two is needed.  Imitation vanilla is composed of artificial flavorings (most of which are paper-industry by-products treated with chemicals) and it often has a harsh quality that leaves a bitter aftertaste.  Vanilla originated in Mexico, and it was once the producer of the finest vanilla, but almost all the extract from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean is now synthetic, and NOT pure vanilla extract.  Product packaging can be confusing:  Natural vanillin is a substance intrinsic to the vanilla bean, but artificial vanillin is made from wood-pulp by-products.  Vanilla flavoring is a blend of pure and imitation vanilla.  Vanilla extract should be added to cooked mixtures after they have been briefly cooled so the flavor does not dissipate.

Brick got it's name because of it's shape, and because cheese-makers originally used bricks to press the moisture from the cheese. Brick ranges in flavor from mild when young, to sharp when aged. Brick is pungent, tangy and dotted with many small holes. It is pale in color and firm in texture. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Limburger~</b> Produced in Bavaria and now considered a German cheese, Limburger originated in Belgium. Made from cow's milk repeated rind-washings in brine are responsible for Limburger's notoriously powerful smell. It is a sharp, soft, and slightly salty cheese. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Muenster~</b> also known as Gerome, the original French Muenster is noted for a huge, beefy, nutty flavor and a very aromatic rind. The washed rind gives French Muenster, from Alsace, it's distinctive smell. Gerome, an identical cheese, though slightly larger, is from Lorraine. The Danish and German Muensters are much milder than the French Variety. American Muenster's rind is not washed at all. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Appenzeller~</b> resembling a Gruyere, Appenzeller is light tan in color which is derived from continuous brushing with a special mixture of spices, wine and salt.

This mountain cheese from Switzerland is made with raw cow's milk. \r\n\r\n<b>Livarot~</b> also known as \"the colonel\" because of the five strips of raffita customarily wrapper around it to stop bulging, Livarot is one of the most pungent French Cheeses. Made from cow's milk this cheese is soft and springy, has a gold interior with little holes. The flavor is strong, beefy, nutty and slightly salty. <p>\r\n\r\n<b>Swiss Tilsit~</b> This cheese is similar to Appenzeller, but softer.

The word zucchini comes from the Italian zucchino, meaning a small squash. The term squash comes from the Indian skutasquash meaning \"green thing eaten green.\" Christopher Columbus originally brought seeds to the Mediterranean region and Africa. The French term for zucchini is courgette, often used interchangably for yellow squash as well.
